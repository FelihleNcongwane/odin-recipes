    <h2>Do You Know Salsa</h2>
    <p>This is usually a spicy sauce of chopped tomatoes, onions and peppers that is commonly served with Mexican food. Also, it can be a similar sauce
        made with a main ingredient other than tomatoes.
    </p>
    <p>Here we are talking about <em>avocado salsa</em> with fresh peaches, bell pepper, red onion, and spicy <em>jalapeno</em> making a delicious summertime dip. Also great as a topper for grilled chicken or fish.
    The longer it can marinate before you add the <em>avocado</em>, the better it is.</p>
